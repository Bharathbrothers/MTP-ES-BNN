#### Abstract:

>  An Expert System can be defined as a knowledge-base system that acquires knowledge
from its knowledge base of a specific domain and addresses user queries using
its inference engine about that specific domain. In the Expert System, we have 3 main
parts(Knowledge Base, Inference Engine, User Interface). It has many applications in
various domains. One of the important domains is predictive maintenance where it helps
in monitoring the health of machinery and helps us to get quick repair solutions with its
knowledge and improve its lifetime. We are using Bayesian Neural Networks(these are
Neural networks in which we use probabilities for weights and biases for prediction) as a
part of the inference engine of the expert system which helps to overcome the uncertainties
from standard Neural Networks and gives confident and dynamic predictions. This
yields us even much better results and helps in effective monitoring of the machinery
both by individuals and organizations.

> Here, we present the usage of Bayesian Neural Networks(BNN’s) for building Expert
Systems. The usage of BNN’s overcomes the drawback of the uncertainty of neural
networks. It also makes predictions more dynamic.
