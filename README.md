Stages:

  [Phase -1: 3rd semester](../blob/master/PHASE -1/1- 3RD SEMESTER MID/MID_TERM_REPORT.pdf)
    
    Mid semester:
     - Learning/Revising Deep Learning and python.
     - Searching/learning about ES.
     - Research Papers collected related to the project.
     - See existing works:
     - Literature Survey:
      - Study all papers related to it and write what they are doing and what they are lacking.
      
    End semester:
    - Implement a basic NN and a basic BNN:
    
  Phase -2: (4th semester)
    
    Mid semester:
     - Implement different versions and variations of BNN using various techniques.
     
    End semester:
    - Implement Expert system web application.

Implementation Steps:
    1.
    2.
    
TO DO:
  - [x] MAKE FOLDERS FOR EACH PHASE AND SUBMISSION (made locally.)
  - [ ] UPLOAD ALL RELATED FILES PHASE AND SUBMISSION WISE
  - [ ] LINK THOSE FOLDERS FROM THIS README FILE SO THAT THEY ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE.
  - [ ] UPLOAD ALL PAPERS, CODES, PLOTS, MODELS AND VERSIONS WHICH ARE IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT.
  - [ ] GO ON.
