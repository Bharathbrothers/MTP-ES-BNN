# Title : Expert Ssystem using Bayesian Neural Networks

Description:

Aim:

Tools and Technologies used:

Stages:

  [Phase -1:3rd semester](../master/PHASE%20-1/)
    
   [Mid semester:](../master/PHASE%20-1/1-%203RD%20SEMESTER%20MID/)
   
      - Learning/Revising Deep Learning and python.
      - Searching/learning about ES.
      - Research Papers collected related to the project.
      - See existing works:
      - Literature Survey:
      - Study all papers related to it and write what they are doing and what they are lacking.
      
   [End semester:](../master/PHASE%20-1/1-%203RD%20SEMESTER%20END/)
   
    - Implement a basic NN and a basic BNN:
    
  [Phase -2: (4th semester)]((../blob/master/PHASE%20-2/))
    
   [Mid semester:](../master/PHASE%20-1/1-%204TH%20SEMESTER%20MID/)
   
     - Implement different versions and variations of BNN using various techniques.
     
   [End semester:](../master/PHASE%20-1/1-%204TH%20SEMESTER%20END/)
   
    - Implement Expert system web application.

Implementation Steps:
    1.
    2.
    
TO DO:
  - [x] MAKE FOLDERS FOR EACH PHASE AND SUBMISSION (made locally.)
  - [ ] UPLOAD ALL RELATED FILES PHASE AND SUBMISSION WISE
  - [ ] LINK THOSE FOLDERS FROM THIS README FILE SO THAT THEY ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE.
  - [ ] UPLOAD ALL PAPERS, CODES, PLOTS, MODELS AND VERSIONS WHICH ARE IMPLEMENTED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT.
  - [ ] GO ON. 
  - [X] added relative links for main folders.
